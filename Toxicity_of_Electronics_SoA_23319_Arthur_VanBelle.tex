\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
\usepackage[colorlinks=true,linkcolor=black,citecolor=black,urlcolor=black]{hyperref}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\IEEEPARstart{W}{hy} does toxicity in everyday electronics matter?
Everyday electronic devices contain a wide range of chemical substances embedded in electronic components, 
wiring, and plastic housings. While many of these substances are chemically inert, others are potentially hazardous to human health. 
In Europe, strict user-safety standards—most notably EN~62368—impose demanding requirements for fire prevention and ignition resistance 
in electrical and electronic equipment. Compliance with these safety standards has historically driven the widespread use of flame-retardant 
materials and other functional additives in electronic devices \cite{Pal2020}. As a result, substances with known toxicological profiles 
remain present in everyday electronics, 
despite parallel European policies aimed at limiting their concentration and associated health risks.
This review focuses on toxic substances currently regulated under European legislation in the context of everyday use of electronic and 
electrical equipment. 
While numerous additional additives and emerging chemicals may be present in electronic devices, these are beyond the primary scope of this work.

Electronic devices can be toxic in multiple ways, and we encounter them in our daily lives.
This state of the art report will only treat about the toxicity of the chemicals contained in the devices.
It is important to know that not only the electronic components themselves contain toxic compounds but also the metal or plastic casing,
the wiring, the solder and other mechanical or electrical items that could be included in most of the electronic devices.

% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or

\section{Toxic Substances in Everyday Electronics}

The most common and well-known toxic chemicals are listed in Table~\ref{tab:toxics_electronics}.
Brominated Flame Retardants (BFR) are a big concern since they are widely used in electronic devices to meet fire safety requirements \cite{Goosey2006}.
The BFRs are extremely present in our lives and are able to bioaccumulate. They are dangerous for most of the living beings as they are endocrine disruptors 
and carcinogenic \cite{Brown2004}\cite{Simonsen2000}.
They are present in printed circuit boards and incorporated in polymers which are used for casing. This means humans are almost constantly in contact with BFRs \cite{Kim2014}.
The two most common BFRs are Polybrominated Biphenyls (PBB) and Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDE).

Another important heavy metal is Lead (Pb). It was widely used in old solders and is still present in some batteries and electronic components.
Lead is extremely toxic for humans and can lead to neurological disorders, especially for children \cite{Flora2012}, reproductive system, immune system, 
nervous system and kidneys disorders \cite{Wadi1999}\cite{Gillis2012}.
It is also restricted by the EU regulations \cite{EU_RoHS_Amendment}.

Phthalates are also widely used in electronic devices as plasticizers.
They are used to increase the flexibility of polymers.
We find them in cable insulation, plastic parts and housings and many other plastic components not directly linked to electronics.
Phthalates exist under multiple forms. Only some phthalates (DEHP, DBP, BBP) are confirmed endocrine disruptors. \cite{Pecht2018}.

\end{table}

Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal used in nickel–cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries, electroplating, and various protective coatings \cite{Morrow2000}. 
It is also present in certain semiconductor materials.
Modern consumer exposure to cadmium during normal use is considered minimal \cite{Morrow2000}\cite{Sharma2015}.
The exposure to cadmium can cause disorder in the immune system,
reproductive system and nervous system \cite{Sharma2015}.

Mercury (Hg) is another heavy metal used in some switches, sensors, lamps, and batteries. Although its use in electronic equipment has been significantly reduced in recent decades,
certain legacy products and specific components may still contain mercury.
Consequently, direct exposure during normal use is generally uncommon, but accidental breakage or improper disposal
can still lead to inhalation of mercury vapour, which is highly toxic and can affect the nervous, digestive, and immune systems \cite{Zulaikhah2020}.

Hexavalent chromium (Cr VI) is used for corrosion-resistant coatings and metal plating.
We find this toxic chemical on printed circuit board to protect the copper traces.
Hexavalent chromium is known to be carcinogenic and can cause respiratory problems.
It can also affect the skin and cause allergic reactions.
The two main exposure pathways are inhalation and dermal contact. \cite{Alvarez2021}

Other toxic chemicals can be found in electronic devices but are less common.
The discussed chemicals are the most widespread and the ones regulated by the European RoHS directive.

\section{Exposure Pathways}
How are we exposed to these toxic chemicals when handling electronic devices?
The main exposure pathways are inhalation, ingestion and dermal contact \cite{EC_SWD_2023_760}.
Table~\ref{tab:exposure_pathways} summarizes the main exposure pathways for each common toxic chemical.
The inhalation of dust particles is a common way to be exposed to toxic chemicals.
Dust particles can originate from handling electronic devices, from material degradation over time, or from chemical migration from new devices during initial use \cite{Yang2020}.
The ingestion of toxic chemicals can happen when we eat or drink without washing our hands after handling electronic devices.
The dermal contact is also a common way to be exposed to toxic chemicals.
We are in contact with electronic devices all day long.

The respective effect on health of each chemicals depends on the exposure pathway.
The age and the health condition of the person exposed are also important factors and children tend to be more vulnerable to toxic chemicals \cite{Flora2012} as their organs are still developing.

\section{EU Regulatory Framework}
Since the toxic chemicals used in electronic devices are harmful for humans and the environment,
we could expect strong regulations to limit their use and exposure.
As the use of these toxic chemicals is widespread and confer important specific properties to electronic devices,
it is difficult to completely ban them. However, the European Union has implemented regulations to limit their use.

The most important regulation is the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) \cite{EU_RoHS_Amendment}.
It restricts the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.
The maximum concentration limits for the most common toxic chemicals in electronics are listed in Table~\ref{tab:toxics_electronics}.
The RoHS directive represents an important step toward reducing exposure to toxic chemicals in electronic devices but it doesn't totally ban them.
However, this could raise the question of whether the regulations are sufficient to protect us since the regulation only limits the concentration of toxic chemicals.
Moreover, as explained in RoHS directive, exemptions are possible, for instance certain device categories purchased before 2019 do not have to comply with the directive.

Another important point is the enforcement of the regulation.
According to an impact assessment report from the European Commission from 2017 \cite{EU2017ImpactAssessment},
23-28\% of the electronic devices placed on the EU market were non-compliant with RoHS directive.
This can be explained by the complexity of the supply chain and the lack of control which makes it difficult for the authorities to control the compliance of every EEE.
The enforcement of the regulation is uneven across the EU member states as well.
As each member state is responsible for the enforcement of the regulation within its territory with its own means\cite{EC_SWD_2023_760}.
Authorities must write reports about non-compliant devices found and they are mainly about electronic devices imported from China\cite{EC_SWD_2023_760}.
This raises the questions of the transparency again as supply chains are complex and not always fully disclosed in foreign countries.
On the other hand an exemption system exists in RoHS. According to the evaluation report from 2023 \cite{EC_SWD_2023_760} the system seems too unclear
and difficult to enforce as well. This also creates vulnerabilities in the regulation as it allows the use for toxic chemicals in a way.

The RoHS directive is not only about the toxicity for humans but also for the environment.
But the main EU regulation dealing with the environmental aspect is the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) \cite{EU_WEEE_Directive}.
It aims to reduce the amount of e-waste and to promote the recycling and reuse of electronic devices.
The recycling of electronic devices and the correct management of e-waste is an important aspect to consider as well.
It is important to regulate the use of toxic chemicals in electronic devices but also to ensure that the devices are recycled properly to avoid environmental contamination.
The protection of the environment is an indirect protection for humans as well. Most of the sources consulted for this review deal with ingestion of toxic chemicals via contaminated food or water as well.

Other EU regulations deal with the toxicity of chemicals in general such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) regulation \cite{EU_REACH_Regulation}.
It also regulates chemicals in the EU market but is not specific to electronic devices.
REACH also covers the exposure to chemicals during manufacturing, recycling and handling.
The regulation leads to mandatory communication about chemicals from companies, supply chain transparency
and pressure to find substitute chemicals to the dangerous one. Many chemicals regulated by RoHS were firstly classified 
as dangerous by REACH regulation. The REACH regulation suffers from the same enforcement issues as RoHS directive though.
As lots of electronic devices are imported from non-EU countries, where supply chain transparency is not always guaranteed.

It should be noted that European regulations such as RoHS and REACH primarily address hazardous substances on an individual basis. 
In real-life conditions, however, users are exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals originating from electronic devices, including regulated substances 
as well as additional additives and degradation products. Current regulatory risk assessment frameworks only rarely account for such combined exposures, 
despite growing evidence that mixture effects may be additive or synergistic, particularly for substances 
with endocrine-disrupting properties \cite{Bopp2018}. This represents an important limitation of existing regulatory approaches 
and a significant knowledge gap in the assessment of health risks associated with everyday electronic devices.

\section{Conclusion}
This review has highlighted the presence of toxic chemicals despite regulations in everyday electronic devices and their potential health risks.
The question of whether current regulations are sufficient to protect us from these toxic chemicals is legitimate.
Even if those chemicals are toxic, they are still widely used in electronic devices due to their specific properties.
It is important to continue researching and monitoring the presence of these toxic chemicals in electronic devices.
Such studies may inform new regulations and promote the development of safer alternatives.
On the question of the toxicity of mixtures of chemicals, is EU able to tackle this issue in the future regulations?
Further research is needed to better understand the combined effects of multiple chemicals present in electronic devices but
ongoing studies suggest that mixture effects may be significant and should be considered in future regulatory frameworks.
It remains unclear whether the EU RoHS and REACH regulations are sufficient to address the widespread non-compliance
of electronic devices, highlighting the need for stronger enforcement and improved supply chain transparency.
Stronger enforcement mechanisms and increased transparency in supply chains may be necessary to ensure better compliance
and protection but what would be the consequences on the EU market?
