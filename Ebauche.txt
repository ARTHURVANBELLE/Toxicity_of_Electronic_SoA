    Bromine (Br), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) are typical chemicals we can 
    find in various electronic components.

    Phtalates were found in outer plastic coating

    Bromine for flame retardants

    Lead 
        - used in solder
        - highly toxic --> Effect on nervous system, hearth, kidney and brain

    Hexavalent chromium
        - corrosion protection of metal
        - carcinogen
    
    Mercury
        - various applications of electronics
        - damage to the central nervous system and kidneys
    
    Cadmium
        - carcinogen
        - damage to kidneys and bone structure
    
    Brominated flame retardants (BFRs)
        - highly persistent in the environment
        - 
    
    Phtalates
        - used as plasticizers in PVC
        - volatile since they are not physically bounded to the PVC
        - damage and changes to human reproduction system
